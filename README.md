# Simon Game

The Simon Game is a memory-based game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game challenges players to repeat an ever-increasing sequence of lights and sounds.

## How to Play

1. Press any key to start the game.
2. The game will display a sequence of colored buttons (Red, Yellow, Green, and Purple) that will light up in a random order.
3. After the sequence is shown, you need to repeat it by clicking the buttons in the same order.
4. If you correctly repeat the sequence, the game will add another color to the sequence and the challenge increases.
5. The game ends if you make an error. Your final score is the length of the sequence you successfully completed.

## Controls

- Use your mouse to click on the colored buttons.
- Press any key to restart the game after a game over.

## Technologies Used
